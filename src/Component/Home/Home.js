                <h1>Fan History:</h1>
                <p>The Japanese invented folding fans in the eighth century, possibly inspired by the way bats fold their wings. But the heyday of the handheld fan was China's Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), when exquisitely painted fans were all the rage. Portuguese traders brought Asian fans to Europe in the 1400s.</p>

                <h1>Cooler History: </h1>
                <p>In 1909, Haws created the Haws Sanitary Drinking Faucet company, and patented his water cooler in 1911. The early water coolers stored water in a sealed glass container, and used large blocks of ice to chill water. This combination of glass and ice would have made for a very heavy install.</p>

                <h1>Freezer History: </h1>
                <p>In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.</p>

                <h1>Heater History:</h1>
                <p>Heating systems have been around for thousands of years from Grecian fixed central hearths from 2500 BC to ancient Roman hypocaust central heating systems. However electric heating is a relatively modern invention that has become an invaluable asset to any home in the winter.</p>

                <h1>Iron History: </h1>
                <p>Archeologists believe that iron was discovered by the Hittites of ancient Egypt somewhere between 5000 and 3000 BCE. During this time, they hammered or pounded the metal to create tools and weapons. They found and extracted it from meteorites and used the ore to make spearheads, tools and other trinkets.</p>
